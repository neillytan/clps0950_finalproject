Here's our CLPS0950 final project! Remember to comment when you've updated your code :) 
Some notes: First represents the display of the first digit options (1 2 3 4  or 6)
Second represents the display of the second digit options (1-7, consistent regardless of first digit)
ThirdA, ThirdB, ThirdC, represent the third digit options (depends on what the second digit is)
